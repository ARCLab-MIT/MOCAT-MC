%****************************************************
%  Direct conversion of igrf11_f to MATLAB
%  USAGE:   [B]=igrf11syn(fyears,alt,nlat,elong) 
% 
%  INPUT:   fyears = date in fractional years e.g. 1909.5 
%           alt    = altitude in                       (km)
%           nlat   = latiude positive north            (deg)

%  CHANGES
%  date replaced by fyears

%  isv and itype preset to 0 and 1, respectively
%  output changed from [x,y,z,f] to non-redundant vector B=[x; y; z];
%The following text is from the fortran comment lines:
%
%     This is a program for synthesising geomagnetic field values from the 
%     International Geomagnetic Reference Field series of models as agreed
%     in December 2009 by IAGA Working Group V-MOD. 
%     It is the 11th generation IGRF, ie the 10th revision. 
%     The main-field models for 1900.0, 1905.0,..1940.0 and 2010.0 are 
%     non-definitive, those for 1945.0, 1950.0,...2005.0 are definitive and
%     the secular-variation model for 2010.0 to 2015.0 is non-definitive.
%
%     Main-field models are to degree and order 10 (ie 120 coefficients)
%     for 1900.0-1995.0 and to 13 (ie 195 coefficients) for 2000.0 onwards. 
%     The predictive secular-variation model is to degree and order 8 (ie 80
%     coefficients).
%
%     Options include values at different locations at different
%     times (spot), values at same location at one year intervals
%     (time series), grid of values at one time (grid); geodetic or
%     geocentric coordinates, latitude & longitude entered as decimal
%     degrees or degrees & minutes (not in grid), choice of main field 
%     or secular variation or both (grid only).
% Recent history of code:
%     Aug 2003: 
%     Adapted from 8th generation version to include new maximum degree for
%     main-field models for 2000.0 and onwards and use WGS84 spheroid instead
%     of International Astronomical Union 1966 spheroid as recommended by IAGA
%     in July 2003. Reference radius remains as 6371.2 km - it is NOT the mean
%     radius (= 6371.0 km) but 6371.2 km is what is used in determining the
%     coefficients. 
%     Dec 2004: 
%     Adapted for 10th generation
%     Jul 2005: 
%     1995.0 coefficients as published in igrf9coeffs.xls and igrf10coeffs.xls
%     now used in code - (Kimmo Korhonen spotted 1 nT difference in 11 coefficients)
%     Dec 2009:
%     Adapted for 11th generation
%
%   INPUT
%     isv   = 0 if main-field values are required
%     isv   = 1 if secular variation values are required
%     date  = year A.D. Must be greater than or equal to 1900.0 and
%             less than or equal to 2015.0. Warning message is given
%             for dates greater than 2010.0. Must be double precision.
%     itype = 1 if geodetic (spheroid)
%     itype = 2 if geocentric (sphere)
%     alt   = height in km above sea level if itype = 1
%           = distance from centre of Earth in km if itype = 2 (>3485 km)
%     colat = colatitude (0-180)
%     elong = east-longitude (0-360)
%     alt, colat and elong must be double precision.
%   OUTPUT
%     x     = north component (nT) if isv = 0, nT/year if isv = 1
%     y     = east component (nT) if isv = 0, nT/year if isv = 1
%     z     = vertical component (nT) if isv = 0, nT/year if isv = 1
%     f     = total intensity (nT) if isv = 0, rubbish if isv = 1
%     B     = [x; y; z]
%
%     To get the other geomagnetic elements (D, I, H and secular
%     variations dD, dH, dI and dF) use routines ptoc and ptocsv.
