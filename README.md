# MOCAT-MC
MIT Orbital Capacity Assessment Toolbox - Monte Carlo

MIT ARCLab's Monte-Carlo Tool for long-term propagation of the LEO environment

## Required modules
MOCAT-MC is developed in MATLAB.

## Examples
For a _Quick_Start_, run:

`./Examples/Quick_Start/Quick_Start.m`

For a _No Future Launch_ scenario starting with the epoch of Jan 1, 2020 in a 3-seed Monte Carlo case, run:

`./Examples/Scenario_No_Launch/Scenario_No_Launch.m`
